ABOUT
-----
deckjs2pdf is an deck.js presentation to PDF converter. It uses WebKit for
generating the slides and for capturing each slide. The slides are then all
merged into a single PDF file.

All rendering is done through WebKit which means that CSS, JavaScript, fonts,
images, etc are all loaded and rendered properly before the conversion to PDF is
done.
